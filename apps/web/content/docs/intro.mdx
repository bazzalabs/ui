## What is bazza/ui?

bazza/ui is a collection of React components and hooks that you can use to build your own component library.

We are building on top of **shadcn/ui**, which you can [learn more about here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

We do not intend to provide primitive components already available in shadcn/ui. In fact, we are using shadcn/ui to provide the primitive components that we need to build our own components.

We are currently in the early stages of development, so expect things to change frequently. We welcome any [feedback](/docs/feedback) or contributions to help us improve.

## What components are offered?

Currently, we provide a single component: a **data table filter** component â€” heavily inspired by the look, feel & functionality found in [Linear](https://linear.app/homepage).

## Why a whole site for a single component?

We have set up the scaffolding to support multiple components, if the need arises.

For now, we have the data table filter component, but we are open to adding more down the road, depending on the interest/demand expressed by the community.
