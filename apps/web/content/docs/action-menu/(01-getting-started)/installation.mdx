## Registry Installation (Recommended)

Want something styled with sensible defaults? Install from our registry with one command.

- Installs the `@bazza-ui/action-menu` package
- Creates the `@/components/ui/action-menu.tsx` file with a styled `ActionMenu` component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.bazza.dev/r/action-menu
```

## NPM Installation

Install the unstyled, primitive component as an npm package:

```bash
npm install @bazza-ui/action-menu
```

### Peer Dependencies

The action menu has the following peer dependencies:

- `react` ^18.0.0 or ^19.0.0
- `react-dom` ^18.0.0 or ^19.0.0

For the responsive drawer functionality on mobile, it uses:

- `vaul` for the drawer component

For positioning and collision detection:

- `@floating-ui/react` for dropdown positioning

## Next Steps

Once installed, head over to [Getting Started](/docs/action-menu/getting-started) to create your first menu.
