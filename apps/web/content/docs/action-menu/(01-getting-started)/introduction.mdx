The action menu is a primitive component for building menu interfaces.

At its core, it combines the best features of the dropdown and command menus available today, while adding deep search capabilities.

## Features

- Data-first API with headless, slot-based rendering.
- Supports submenus with [intent zones](https://linear.app/now/invisible-details) for easy, fluid pointer navigation.
- Deep search across submenus; descendants are searchable from ancestors.
- Fully typed with generics for your own menu data, customizable per submenu.
- Full keyboard navigation with vim-style keybindings built-in.
- Responsive design; renders a dropdown on desktop and a [drawer](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski) on mobile.
- Supports modal and non-modal modes.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Focus is fully managed; follows the `aria-activedescendant` pattern.
