# Intent Zone

The intent zone (also called "aim guard") prevents accidental submenu closures when moving the mouse diagonally toward a submenu.

## The Problem

Without intent zones, moving your mouse diagonally from a menu item to its submenu often causes the submenu to close:

1. Mouse is over "Users" menu item
2. "Users" submenu opens to the right
3. User moves mouse diagonally toward submenu
4. Mouse briefly leaves "Users" item
5. Submenu closes unexpectedly ❌

## The Solution

Intent zones create a triangular "safe zone" where the mouse can travel without closing the submenu:

```
Menu Item → [Safe Triangle Zone] → Submenu
   Users    \                  /
             \                /
              \              /
               \            /
                \          /
                 Submenu
```

## How It Works

1. Mouse hovers over a menu item
2. Submenu opens
3. Intent zone calculates a triangle from:
   - Current mouse position
   - Top corner of submenu
   - Bottom corner of submenu
4. While mouse is inside triangle, submenu stays open
5. Once mouse exits triangle, normal hover behavior resumes

## Automatic Detection

Intent zones only activate on devices with fine pointer control (mouse):

```tsx
// Automatically enabled for mouse users
<ActionMenu.Root>
  {/* Intent zones active on desktop */}
</ActionMenu.Root>

// Automatically disabled on touch devices
// No configuration needed!
```

## Debug Mode

Visualize the intent zone during development:

```tsx
<ActionMenu.Root debug>
  {/* Shows the triangular safe zone as a visual overlay */}
</ActionMenu.Root>
```

The debug visualization shows:
- **Green triangle** - Active safe zone
- **Red outline** - Submenu boundaries
- Updates in real-time as mouse moves

## Configuration

Intent zones work automatically, but you can customize timing:

```tsx
<ActionMenu.Root
  hoverPolicy={{
    intentTimeout: 300 // ms to wait before closing
  }}
>
  {/* Customize hover behavior */}
</ActionMenu.Root>
```

## Performance

Intent zones are highly optimized:

- Uses pointer events (not mousemove)
- Debounced position tracking
- Efficient geometric calculations
- No impact on touch devices

## Browser Compatibility

Intent zones work in all modern browsers:

- Chrome/Edge 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+

## Accessibility

Intent zones don't affect keyboard navigation:

- Keyboard users navigate normally
- Screen readers unaffected
- Focus management unchanged

## Best Practices

- Enable debug mode during development
- Test diagonal mouse movements
- Ensure submenus are positioned consistently
- Don't override hover policies unless necessary

## Related Features

Intent zones work seamlessly with:

- **Positioning** - Automatically adapts to submenu position
- **Responsive Behavior** - Only active in dropdown mode
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Doesn't interfere with keyboard

## Advanced: Custom Hover Policies

For advanced use cases, implement custom hover behavior:

```tsx
import { HoverPolicyContext } from '@bazza-ui/action-menu'

<HoverPolicyContext.Provider value={customPolicy}>
  <ActionMenu.Root>
    {/* Custom hover logic */}
  </ActionMenu.Root>
</HoverPolicyContext.Provider>
```

## Why It Matters

Intent zones dramatically improve UX for nested menus:

- **Fewer accidental closures** - Users can move freely
- **Faster navigation** - Less precision required
- **Less frustration** - Natural diagonal movements work
- **Professional feel** - Matches native OS menus

## Comparison

| Without Intent Zone | With Intent Zone |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Must move in perfect L-shape | Can move diagonally |
| Frequent accidental closes | Stays open reliably |
| Requires precise mouse control | Forgiving and natural |
| Frustrating for users | Smooth experience |
