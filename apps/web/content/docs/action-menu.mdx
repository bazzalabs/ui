The action menu is a primitive component for building menu interfaces.

At its core, it combines the best features of the dropdown and command menus available today, while adding deep search capabilities.

## Features

- Data-first API with headless, slot-based rendering.
- Supports submenus with [intent zones](https://linear.app/now/invisible-details) for easy, fluid pointer navigation.
- Deep search across submenus; descendants are searchable from ancestors.
- Fully typed with generics for your own menu data, customizable per submenu.
- Full keyboard navigation with vim-style keybindings built-in.
- Supports modal and non-modal modes.
- Customize side, alignment, offsets, collision handling.
- Focus is fully managed; follows the `aria-activedescendant` pattern.

## Installation

Install the unstyled, primitive component as an npm package:

```bash
npm install @bazza-ui/action-menu
```

Want something styled with sensible defaults? Install from our registry with one command.

- Installs the `@bazza-ui/action-menu` package
- Creates the `@/components/ui/action-menu.tsx` file with a styled `ActionMenu` component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.bazza.dev/r/action-menu
```

## References

Thanks to @sunnie for the initial suggestion to switch the data table filter selector menu to a submenu-based approach. 
I began diving into how we could combine Radix's dropdown menu with Paco's command menu, which left me surprised and disappointed in the result.
This ultimately led to building everything from scratch, and thus the action menu was born.
